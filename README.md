# Solutions for The Hitchhiker's Guide to Linear Models

This repository contains the codes that I used in the book [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Linear Models: Based on the famous R programming language](https://leanpub.com/linear-models-guide).

The approach is the same I explained in *Recommended Workflow*, the fourth chapter of the book.

The codes are organized in one RStudio project per chapter, and the difference with respect to the book is that I put the packages at the start of each script, instead of when I need to use them for a specific example.

I included the data in the event that the links change in the future.

Please notice that the codes are not commented, because I already did that in the book.
